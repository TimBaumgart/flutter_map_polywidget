# flutter_map_polywidget

`flutter_map_polywidget` is a [flutter_map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map) plugin for
displaying any widget on the map.

## Features

- choose the location and size of the desired area and display any widget you want
- define the location by
    - center, width, height and angle
    - two exact and one approximated point
- define whether the widget should rotate with the users view, restrict it to one orientation or
  disable rotation completely

## Getting started

Add `flutter_map_polywidget` to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```
dependencies:
  flutter_map_polywidget: any # or latest verion
```

## Usage

Start by adding a `PolyWidgetLayer` to your map:

```dart 
FlutterMap(
  children: [
    ...
    PolyWidgetLayer(
      polyWidgets: [
        ...
      ],
    ),
  ],
),
```

Add `PolyWidget` widgets inside your `PolyWidgetLayer`. PolyWidgets can be created in two ways.

First, by defining the center location, the width, the height and the angle of your widget:

```dart             
PolyWidget(
  center: LatLng(50.933465, 6.875109),
  widthInMeters: 100,
  heightInMeters: 200,
  angle: 90,
  child: ...,
),
```

Second, by defining three corners of the desired widget on the map. The first and second corners are
fixed and will be used to define the width and angle of your widget. The third corner is only fixed
if it is placed in a 90Â° angle from the second corner. Otherwise the distance from the second to the
third corner is used to calculate the actual third corner. All three corners are used to calculate
the center location.

```dart 
PolyWidget.threePoints(
  pointA: LatLng(50.936614, 6.876283),
  pointB: LatLng(50.936498, 6.877663),
  approxPointC: LatLng(50.935312, 6.877419),
  child: ...,
),
```

By default, your widget rotates automatically so it lines up with the current rotation of the map.
To disable that, set `noRotation` to `true`:

```dart 
PolyWidget(
  ...,
  noRotation: true,
  child: ...,
),
```

If you want your widget to only rotate to `portrait` or `landscape` orientation, you can do that by
defining `forceOrientation`:

```dart                
PolyWidget(
  ...,
  forceOrientation: Orientation.landscape, //or Orientation.portrait
  child: ...,
),
```

You can find the example shown in the showcase video in `/example`.
